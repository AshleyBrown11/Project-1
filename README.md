# Tic Tac Toe Game

For my first project in bootcamp I created a  simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML was used first to link both my css and javascript as well as to add my div and button.

CSS was used to create the grid and style the game.

Javascript was used to add arrow functions, arrays, sounds, and eventlisteners in order for us to be able to play the 2 player game. 

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. The game board consists of a 3x3 grid. Players take turns to click on an empty cell to place their symbol ('X' or 'O').
3. The game checks for a win state after each move. A player wins if they have three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
4. If the board is full and no player has won, the game is a cat.
5. Click the "Start New Round" button to reset the board and start a new round.
6. Keep playing multiple rounds until you decide to stop.

Improvements I would like to make is to add sound and add pictures in place of the "X" and "O". I would also like to add the strike function when a winner has been declared.
